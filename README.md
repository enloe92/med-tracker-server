### Endpoints

#### Auth Endpoints

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

For User authentication upon login

| Body Key    | Type        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| user_name   | string      | Required. User username |
| password    | string      | Required. User password |

#### Users Endpoints

```
POST /api/users
```

For User account creation.  There are checks on password requirements and if the user_name is currently in
the database.  JSON Web Tokens are used to hash the password

| Body Key    | Type        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| user_name   | string      | Required. User username |
| password    | string      | Required. User password |

#### Games Endpoints

The User currently cannot POST games, all of that comes from what is already in the database
The user will get the games 1 of 3 ways, all games will output in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "int",
    "game_name": "string"
  }
]
```

There are 3 GET requests:

```
GET /api/games/all
```

As the title suggests, returns all games in the database

```
GET /api/games
```

This will return the user's games (user id required through middleware)

```
GET /api/games/:game_id
```

This will return one singular game based on id

### Rules Endpoints

The Rules endpoints utilize ALL CRUD functions, only GET and POST will return any JSON data
The rest will just return status codes based on endpoint.  JSON data will be returned as such:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "int",
    "game_id": "int",
    "game_name": "string",
    "rule_title": "string",
    "rule_descripion": "string",
    "assigned_user": "int"
  }
]
```

```
GET /api/rules
```

Returns all Rules

```
GET /api/rules/games/:game_id
```

Returns all of the user's rules (user id obtained through middleware) for the specific game

```
GET /api/rules/search/:game_id
```

The opposite of the last GET, this returns all games that are NOT assigned to the user

```
POST /api/rules
```

This will create a new user rule.  user_id and game_id for assigning obtained through middleware
will also manually to the join table for games assigned to that user

| Body Key    | Type        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| rule_title  | string      | Title for the rule|
| rule_description    | string      | Required. The actual rule itself |

```
PATCH /api/rules/:rule_id
```

Has same requirements as above but for updating the user's rule for tweaks

```
DELETE /api/rules/:rule_id
```

Removes the rule

*note, DELETE and PATCH require that the user's id matches the rule's assigned user*
